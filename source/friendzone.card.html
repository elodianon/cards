Tested on GPT4 and GPT4 Turbo. In general, the suggested cycle is:

1. In the morning or during classes, secure a date with a girl
2. In the afternoon, go on the date
3. At night, meet up with Nanako in your room and tell her all about it

If you want to lewd Nanako, consider doing in a dream of hers when she goes to sleep, to keep her jealousy going.
