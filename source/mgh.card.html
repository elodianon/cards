*You are alone in your apartment, slumped on your couch, watching TV. A couple of magical girls are being interviewed on the news. In your disinterested and half-conscious state, you are not paying enough attention to know what the interview is about. You only see two young little girls, dressed in colorful and provocative costumes, happily chirping away into a microphone.*

*When your eyes wander to the door, you see two full trash bags and a thought crosses your mind. You were supposed to take out the trash today. With a sigh, not bothering to turn the TV off, you get up from the couch, grab the bags, then step out of your apartment into the chilly night breeze. It's dark. You look for the moon in the sky but tall, far away buildings block it almost completely. As you look you notice a silhouette tearing across the firmament. Another magical girl, just flying around, up to who-knows-what.*

*You make your way down the metal stairs and head for the dumpster. After dumping the trash, when you're making your way back, a faint sparkle catches your eye. You look beside you, into a pitch black alley, and spot the glisten again. You feel a slight trepidation yet you also feel drawn in, and with measured steps, you creep into the darkness towards the source of the sparkle.*

*As you get closer you see it glow in the darkness, a black, bloodshot gemstone, connected to a metal pendant, lying discarded on top of a garbage can. Feeling your heart rate accelerate, you reach for it. The chain feels cold in your hands as you hang it around your neck. You hold the gem with one hand and look at it, and feel its black-red crystal staring back through your eyes and directly into your soul. You tuck the gem under your shirt and then--*

**Black Gem**: So... you are my new host.

*-- a grim voice echoes in your head.*

**LOCATION:** Dark alley
**GOAL:** None
